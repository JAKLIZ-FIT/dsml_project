Group 1: Zalan, Phat, Shanaya, Jiri
# Tasks
## Common Tasks
- Q1: Create a predictive model for the attribute ***weight_in_kg***
- Q2: Create a predictive model for the attribute ***error_type***
## Solo Tasks
- Create predictive models for further product characteristics so that they come to at least 2 analyses per person (different models). 
- Explain the concepts you used for data analysis (for the target group) 
- Evaluate and review your results 
- Note: If applicable, you can also show that a good prediction (using the models we have covered) is not possible.
Build prediction models for other features.

Jiri: IonizationClass, ReflectionScore
Phat: multidamentional, error
Shanaya: pressure, niceness
Zalan: quality, distortion
